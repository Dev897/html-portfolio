<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>An epic story of how a son avenges his father's death commited by his Uncle. A family friendly movie.</p>

<h3>Like Mike</h3>
<p>An orphan who loves basketball, gets his hands on a pair of MJ sneakers from a donation. This helps him play 
basketball professionally and with some hurdles on the way.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>Most awaited Batman movie in my opinion, saw it first day, first show. Its the comeback of Batman against Bane his 
    enemy in the movie.</p>
